## 🏗️ **What We've Built (COMPLETED)**

### ✅ **Phase 1: Database Schema & Backend**

- **Database Tables Created**:

  - `companies` - Company information and billing details
  - `company_roles` - User roles within companies (owner, admin, manager, member, billing_contact)
  - `project_access` - Granular project permissions for users
  - Enhanced `projects` table with billing_type, company_id, billing_contact_id
  - Enhanced `users` table with company fields

- **Backend Functions (lib/auth.ts)**:
  - Company CRUD operations
  - User-company role management
  - Project access control
  - Auto-user creation with role assignment

### ✅ **Phase 2: Admin Interface**

- **Companies Tab** in admin dashboard
- **Company Creation Form** with owner assignment
- **User Management Modal** with:
  - Add users to companies (with role selection)
  - View all company users
  - Change user roles via dropdown
  - Remove users from companies
  - Auto-create user accounts if they don't exist

### ✅ **Phase 3: Authentication & Navigation**

- **Enhanced Navigation** with login/logout
- **Role-based Dashboard Links** (admin → /admin, clients → /dashboard/{id})
- **User Menu Dropdown** with logout functionality
- **Login Page** (/login) for general access

### ✅ **Phase 4: Project Access Management**

- **"Manage Access" Button** on each project in admin interface
- **Project Access Management Modal** with:
  - Grant access to users (with email auto-creation)
  - Access level selection (Owner, Collaborator, Viewer)
  - Granular permissions (view_demo, view_files, comment, approve, download)
  - View all users with project access
  - Change user access levels via dropdown
  - Remove user access from projects
  - Real-time permissions preview

### **Database Verification Queries**

```sql
-- Check companies
SELECT * FROM companies ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check company roles
SELECT cr.*, u.name, u.email, c.name as company_name
FROM company_roles cr
JOIN users u ON cr.user_id = u.id
JOIN companies c ON cr.company_id = c.id
ORDER BY cr.assigned_at DESC;

-- Check users
SELECT id, email, name, role, created_at
FROM users ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## 🚀 **How to Continue Development**

### **Immediate Next Task**

1. **Test User Management Interface**

   - Create dual workflow (Project→Users & User→Projects)

### **Key Requirements Remaining**

- Multi-user project access (main goal)
- Project-level permissions
- Client dashboard showing all accessible projects
- Email notifications (hold off on real emails)
