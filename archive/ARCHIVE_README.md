# Archive Directory

This directory contains markdown files that are no longer relevant to the current state of the Jigsaw Techie website project.

## Archived Files

### SUPABASE_SETUP_archived.md
- **Original**: `SUPABASE_SETUP.md`
- **Reason**: This was a detailed setup guide for the initial Supabase configuration. Since the project is now fully set up and running with a complete company management system, this initial setup guide is no longer needed for day-to-day operations.
- **Current Status**: The project now has a mature database schema with companies, users, projects, and access management - far beyond the basic quote system this guide was written for.

### Initial_AI_Prompt_archived.md
- **Original**: `nogit/Initial_AI_Prompt.md`
- **Reason**: This was the initial prompt/specification for building the website. The project has evolved significantly beyond this initial scope, now including:
  - Complete company management system
  - Multi-user project access control
  - Admin dashboard with user management
  - Authentication system
  - Project access management interface
- **Current Status**: The current `PROJECT_STATUS.md` provides up-to-date information about the project's actual state.

## Files Kept Active

- **Status**: ACTIVE - This file accurately reflects the current state of the project with detailed information about the company management system, database schema, and implemented features.
